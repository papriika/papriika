## Paid accounts
_Last updated: Apr 23, 2020_

The following policies for billing, cancellations and refunds.

_Billing_. You can join Papriika by signing up and turning your account into a “Papriika Paid Account”. We’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Papriika Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. If you’re on an annual plan, we’ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.

_No Refunds_. You may cancel your Papriika Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law.

_Downgrades_. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.

_Changes_. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.

### Can I get a refund on a Papriika subscription?

In most cases, subscriptions for **Papriika subscriptions are non-refundable**.

If you think there’s been an error in billing, please [contact our support team](support@papriika.com) and we’ll work with you to find a solution. 

#### How to request a direct debit refund

If you paid for your Papriika subscription with a direct debit payment, please contact your bank for a refund as only your bank can process a chargeback request.

#### What happens when I submit a chargeback request?

Any chargeback requested from your bank will result in an immediate subscription cancellation and ineligibility for any subscription renewals in the future.

If you have a Papriika subscription, a chargeback request will cause your account to become locked.

#### Live in the E.U. or Turkey?

If you live in the E.U. or Turkey, you’re eligible for a refund if you cancel your Dropbox Plus or Professional subscription within 14 days of purchase.

To request a refund, [send us an email](support@papriika.com) and include your country of residence.
